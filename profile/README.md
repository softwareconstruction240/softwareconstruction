## Welcome to CS `240` - Advanced Software Construction

Advanced Software Construction provides you with the experience and skills necessary to use a modern programming language in an advanced development environment to design, test, and build a large multi-user application. Your application will have a client frontend program that communicates, over the network, with a centralized backend server.

The content for this course is represented by the following parts.

- [Instruction](https://github.com/softwareconstruction240/.github/blob/main/instruction/modules.md#readme)
- [Spelling Corrector](https://github.com/softwareconstruction240/.github/blob/main/spelling-corrector/spelling-corrector.md#readme)
- [Chess](https://github.com/softwareconstruction240/.github/blob/main/chess/chess.md#readme)
- Assignments, quizzes, and tests submitted through Canvas

## Outcomes

By the end of the course you should have experienced the following outcomes.
