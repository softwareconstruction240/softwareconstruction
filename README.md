## Welcome

Advanced Software Construction provides you with the experience and skills necessary to use a modern programming language in an advanced development environment to design, test, and build a large multi-user application. Your application will have a client frontend program that communicates, over the network, with a centralized backend server.

The content for this course is represented by the following parts.

- [Instruction](instruction/modules.md#readme) - Course topics
- [Chess](chess/chess.md#readme) - Instructions for building your application
- [Pet Shop](petshop/petshop.md) - Demonstration application
- **Canvas** - Submit assignments and tests

## Course Schedule
