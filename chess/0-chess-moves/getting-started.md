# Chess Game - Getting Started

📁 [Starter code](starter-code)

At this point, you have already made your own copy of the [Chess GitHub Repository](../chess-github-repository/chess-github-repository.md) and made changes from the command line. Now, we will open the project in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). IDE's greatly help and assist the developer while working on large software projects.

Take the following steps to set up your Chess project.

## Open With IntelliJ

Open the project directory in IntelliJ to start developing, running, and debugging your code using an IDE. Make sure you **OPEN** the project rather than creating a new project.

1. Open Intelli-J. We assume you already have the IDE downloaded from previous required coursework.
2. Choose File > Open > and select the chess folder in the location you created it earlier.

The contents of the folder already contain IntelliJ configuration files and creating a new project rather than opening an existing one will cause various errors.

> [!NOTE]
> If you get a prompt asking you to build with Maven, then make sure you skip that action.

Your project should look like this when it opens with the client, server, and shared folders having a blue square and being at the root level. There should be no folder called chess showing up in your Intelij project, only the items inside of the chess folder should be visible.
