- [TA Tips](../../instruction/chess-tips/chess-tips.md#phase-6---gameplay): A collection of common problems for this phase

For the final part of the Chess Project, you will implement gameplay. Gameplay will use WebSocket to communicate between client and server (instead of Web APIs). When a user begins playing or observes a game, their client should establish a WebSocket connection with the server. The WebSocket connection exchanges messages between client and server (and vice versa). Figure 1 shows a recommended design for the chess client.

## Getting Started
Complete the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) instructions before working on this phase.


## Gameplay Functionality

The gameplay UI should draw the current state of the chess board from the side the user is playing. If playing white, white pieces should be drawn on bottom. If playing black, black pieces should be drawn on bottom. If the user is observing the game, white pieces should be drawn on bottom.

The gameplay UI should support the following user commands:

| Command                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Help**                  | Displays text informing the user what actions they can take.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Redraw Chess Board**    | Redraws the chess board upon the user’s request.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Leave**                 | Removes the user from the game (whether they are playing or observing the game). The client transitions back to the Post-Login UI.                                                                                                                 |
| **Make Move**             | Allow the user to input what move they want to make. The board is updated to reflect the result of the move, and the board automatically updates on all clients involved in the game.                                                              |
| **Resign**                | Prompts the user to confirm they want to resign. If they do, the user forfeits the game and the game is over. Does not cause the user to leave the game.                                                                                           |
| **Highlight Legal Moves** | Allows the user to input the piece for which they want to highlight legal moves. The selected piece’s current square and all squares it can legally move to are highlighted. This is a local operation and has no effect on remote users’ screens. |

![highlight moves](highlight-moves.png)

### Notifications

When the following events occur, notification messages should be displayed on the screen of each player that is involved in the game (player or observer).

1. A user connected to the game as a player (black or white). The notification message should include the player’s name and which side they are playing (black or white).
1. A user connected to the game as an observer. The notification message should include the observer’s name.
1. A player made a move. The notification message should include the player’s name and a description of the move that was made. (This is in addition to the board being updated on each player’s screen.)
1. A player left the game. The notification message should include the player’s name.
1. A player resigned the game. The notification message should include the player’s name.
1. A player is in check. The notification message should include the player’s name (this notification is generated by the server).
1. A player is in checkmate. The notification message should include the player’s name (this notification is generated by the server).

## Gameplay Initiation

During gameplay, all communication between the players is implemented by sending WebSocket messages between clients and the server. Using WebSocket allows the server to send a message at any time to any of the connected clients. For example, when a player sends a move message to the server, the server broadcasts the move to all participants asynchronously.

When a user begins playing or observing a game, their **client** will do the following:

1. **Players** join a game by calling the server's join HTTP endpoint. **Observers** do not call the join endpoint.
1. Open a WebSocket connection with the server (using the `/ws` endpoint) in order to send and receive gameplay messages.
1. Send a CONNECT WebSocket message to the server.
1. Transition to the gameplay UI. The gameplay UI draws the chess board received with the LOAD_GAME message. The gameplay UI allows the user to perform the gameplay commands described in the [Gameplay Functionality](#gameplay-functionality) section.

The following sections describe the messages that will be exchanged between client and server (or vice versa) to implement the gameplay functionality.

## WebSocket Communication

```mermaid

  client
  server
  client e1@--> |UserGameCommand|server
  server e2@--> |ServerMessage|client
  e1@{ animation: fast }
  e2@{ animation: fast }

```

Some WebSocket messages are sent from the client to server. As defined by the Chess application design, these are called `user game commands`. Other WebSocket messages are sent from the server to client. These are called `server messages`. In code, each of these message types are represented as a Java class that can be serialized and deserialized to and from JSON (similar to the Request and Result classes you created for the server’s Web API). The provided starter code includes a class named `UserGameCommand` which defines the required messages that originate from the client, and a class named `ServerMessage` which defines the required messages that originate from the server.

The `UserGameCommand` and `ServerMessage` classes are provided in the starter code, but you may extend them to suit the specific needs of your design.

### User Game Commands

The following is a simplified representation of the `UserGameCommand` found in the starter code.

```java
public class UserGameCommand {
    public enum CommandType {
        CONNECT,
        MAKE_MOVE,
        LEAVE,
        RESIGN
    }

    public CommandType commandType;
    public String authToken;
    public Integer gameID;
}
```

Here are the different command types that a user game command can represent.

| Command       | Required Additional Fields | Description                                                                          |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **CONNECT**   |                            | Used for a user to make a WebSocket connection as a player or observer.              |
| **MAKE_MOVE** | ChessMove move             | Used to request to make a move in a game.                                            |
| **LEAVE**     |                            | Tells the server you are leaving the game so it will stop sending you notifications. |
| **RESIGN**    |                            | Forfeits the match and ends the game (no more moves can be made).                    |

The following diagram represents a possible extension of the `UserGameCommand` class that you could make in order to support the required `ChessMove` field of the MAKE_MOVE command. You are free to follow this design, or come up with a representation of your own.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class UserGameCommand {
        commandType: CommandType
        authToken: String
        gameID: Integer
    }
    class MakeMoveCommand {
        move: ChessMove
    }
    UserGameCommand <|-- MakeMoveCommand

```

In the end, the important thing is that your design supports the additional `move` field when serializing the `MAKE_MOVE` command over the WebSocket. This must result in something like the following:

```json
{
  "commandType": "MAKE_MOVE",
  "authToken": "tokengoeshere",
  "gameID": "337",
  "move": { "start": { "row": 3, "col": 3 }, "end": { "row": 5, "col": 5 } }
}
```

### Server Messages

The following is a simplified representation of the `ServerMessage` found in the starter code.

```java
public class ServerMessage {
   public enum ServerMessageType {
       LOAD_GAME,
       ERROR,
       NOTIFICATION
   }

   ServerMessageType serverMessageType;
}
```

Here are the different command types that a server message can represent.

| Command          | Required Fields                                        | Description                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LOAD_GAME**    | game (can be any type, just needs to be called `game`) | Used by the server to send the current game state to a client. When a client receives this message, it will redraw the chess board. |
| **ERROR**        | String errorMessage                                    | This message is sent to a client when it sends an invalid command. The message must include the word `Error`.                       |
| **NOTIFICATION** | String message                                         | This is a message meant to inform a player when another player made an action.                                                      |

The following diagram represents possible extensions of the `ServerMessage` class that you could use to support the different `ServerMessage` commands. You are free to follow this design, or come up with a representation of your own. Just make sure the required fields are included in your JSON serialization.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ServerMessage {
        serverMessageType : ServerMessageType
    }
    class LoadGameMessage {
        game: any
    }
    class ErrorMessage {
        errorMessage: String
    }
    class NotificationMessage {
        message: String
    }
    ServerMessage <|-- LoadGameMessage
    ServerMessage <|-- ErrorMessage
    ServerMessage <|-- NotificationMessage
```

## WebSocket Interactions

A client will instigate all gameplay interactions by sending a CONNECT `UserGameCommand` to the server. We refer to the instigating client as the `Root Client`. The server will receive this Command and send appropriate `ServerMessages` to all clients connected to that game.

When sending a `Notification` that refers to one of the clients, the message should use the Clients username. (E.g., `Bob left the game`).

If a `UserGameCommand` is invalid (e.g. invalid authToken or gameID doesn’t exist) the server should only send an `Error` message informing the Root Client what went wrong. No messages should be sent to the other clients. The Error message must contain the word `error` (case doesn’t matter).

**Root Client sends CONNECT**

1. Server sends a `LOAD_GAME` message back to the root client.
1. Server sends a `Notification` message to all **other clients** in that game informing them the root client connected to the game, either as a player (in which case their color must be specified) or as an observer.

**Root Client sends MAKE_MOVE**

1. Server verifies the validity of the move.
1. Game is updated to represent the move. Game is updated in the database.
1. Server sends a `LOAD_GAME` message to all clients in the game (including the root client) with an updated game.
1. Server sends a `Notification` message to all **other clients** in that game informing them what move was made.
1. If the move results in check, checkmate or stalemate the server sends a `Notification` message to **all clients**.

**Root Client sends LEAVE**

1. If a player is leaving, then the game is updated to remove the root client. Game is updated in the database.
1. Server sends a `Notification` message to all **other clients** in that game informing them that the root client left. This applies to both players and observers.

**Root Client sends RESIGN**

1. Server marks the game as over (no more moves can be made). Game is updated in the database.
1. Server sends a `Notification` message to **all clients** in that game informing them that the root client resigned. This applies to both players and observers.

## ☑ Deliverable

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> You are required to commit to GitHub with every minor milestone. For example, after you implement each player action. This should result in a commit history that clearly details your work on this phase. If your Git history does not demonstrate your efforts then your submission may be rejected.

### Pass Off Tests

The provided tests for this assignment are in the `WebSocketTests` class. These test the `WebSocket` interactions between client and server. To run the tests first start your server, and then run `WebSocketTests`.

### Code Quality

For this phase the auto grader will grade the quality of your project's source code. The rubric used to evaluate code quality can be found here: [Rubric](../code-quality-rubric.md)

### Pass Off, Submission, and Grading

All of the tests in your project must succeed in order to complete this phase.

To pass off this assignment submit your work to the course [auto-grading](https://cs240.click/) tool. When that is done, meet with a TA and demonstrate that your Chess client and server meet all requirements and assign you a final grade.

#### TA Passoff Prep

Before coming to meet with a TA to passoff your Phase 5, please make sure that you test your code so you know that it can do the following

- You can have 3 terminals running at once, one for white, one for black, and one for the observer
- Making a move will send a move notification to the all but the root user, and everyone should have their board update immediately
- Print an error when trying to make a move out of turn, or a piece that isn't your color, or a piece that doesn't exist
- You can promote a pawn when it gets to the final rank
- Highlight shouldn't crash if you highlight a spot where there is not piece
- Observer should be able to join a game, recieve notifications about a move made, and leave the game, no longer recieving notificaitons about a move being made
- Delivering checkmate should send a checkmate notification to all players, in addition to the move notification and load board like a normal move should do
- Resigning should require a confirmation before sending the resign command. After resignation, the players are still in the game until they leave, and no more moves are allowed to be made

### Grading Rubric

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can receive 4 points of extra credit by first receiving 100% from the autograder and then completing an in-person pass off before the day of final due date.
